# runway

A sideproject born in the summer of 2015. The idea was to create a place where people could upload photos and crowd source opinions on it. Posters would take a photo of themself, tag the items they are wearing with the brands, and then post it. Reviewers would reddit style upvote the items they like and in exchange, reveal the brands of the items.
